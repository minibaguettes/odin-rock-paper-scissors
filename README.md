# ODIN Rock Paper Scissors

This is a rock-paper-scissors project from [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors). 

The goal of this project is to:
1. practice utilizing the javascript (DOM manipulation/events) taught in the course
2. practice and continue learning additional javascript and css (timing, animations)
3. challenge myself to add a theme and make rock-paper-scissors more interesting

I have recently gotten into Persona 5 Royal, and decided it would make the project more intruiging.
I do not own any of the characters or designs.
